# Program Overview
## Program Goals
My primary goal is to provide you guys with a basic understanding of the things that hold the internet together, and to provide you guys with a strong foundation in at least one programming language (Python, in this case). We're going to be focusing on gaining some level of mastery in the language, and then we'll be focusing on doing various data analysis tasks in the language. We'll also be focusing on interacting with various APIs, focusing primarily on Twitter and Facebook (LinkedIn if we have time).

## Workshops
1. Introduction to Python, Part I
2. Introduction to Python, Part II
3. Text Analysis
4. Working with CSV/TSV Files

4. Python
   * Simple, easy-to-use scripting language, very popular in web development
   * Dynamically-typed, interpreted, not statically-typed, not compiled
   * So much better than Java for web
5. XML/JSON
   * Data interchange formats, used by websites to communicate with browser
   * XML is set of tags
     * HTML is special case of XML
   * JSON is more lightweight than XML, but a bit less readable
6. API
   * Not set of unified technologies, but an interface which you can use to access a site
   * Example of Twitter API

## What We'll Be Covering
1. Web Development
   * Building our own web page
   * Starting off with HTML skeleton
   * Adding CSS styling
   * Proving motion with JS/JQuery
2. Programming: Python
   * Building basic Bank Account system
   * Creating class that allows us to check how much we have in bank account
3. Data Gathering
   * Scraping data from social networks
