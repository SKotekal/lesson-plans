# Program Overview
## Program Goals
My primary goal is to provide you guys with a basic understanding of the things that hold the internet together, and to provide you guys with a strong foundation in at least one programming language (Python, in this case). We're going to be focusing on gaining some level of mastery in the language, and then we'll be focusing on doing various data analysis tasks in the language. We'll also be focusing on interacting with various APIs, focusing primarily on Twitter and Facebook (LinkedIn if we have time).
