XML & JSON Workshop Yujia Pan // IOP TechTeam // 04 Nov 2014

What are they, why are they useful? Compare & contrast.

XML (Extensible Markup Language) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) are two
ways that we, humans, can encode data in a way that machines can easily parse &
understand. They are basically ways for us to transmit data over the web & load
it into our applications, etc. Think blog feeds, or getting data from Twitter.

XML was the how people did open data sharing for a while (documents, audio,
video, numbers, etc.). JSON is more lightweight, but you can really only do text
and numbers, whereas XML can handle a lot more data formats. (We say XML is more
extensible.) They are both human readable, but JSON a bit more so. If you can
read Python, you can read json, it’s all valid Python code.

For sharing most data, JSON is better, since it stores data in arrays; XML
stores data in trees, which are more foreign to object-oriented (OO) languages.
So for sharing documents though, XML is better, since it preserves formatting,
images, and stuff like that.

Note how readable it is, even if you’ve never heard of it before.

You probably won’t write XML or JSON; rather, you're more likely to be using it
to transmit data, or trying to parse it to get data you want from JSON or XML
files.

What we will cover in today’s workshop: 
Basic XML and JSON parsing
	json library - also explain what a library is. 
	

Using JSON to load data into an application (Flickr, Twitter?) Incorporate some review stuff along the way Do
stuff with it.
