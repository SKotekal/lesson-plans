# Twitter Data Workshop

(Adapted from *Mining the Social Web, 2nd Ed.*)

In this workshop, we'll be cozying up to the Twitter API and analyzing content of tweets.

## Basics

Every tweet is associated with two groups of things: *entities* and *places*. Entities are things like hashtags (#tbt), handles (@uchicago, @hitRECordJoe), and URLs (http://www.theonion.com/). Places generally denote where the tweet was written.
