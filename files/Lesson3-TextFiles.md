# Working with Text Files
Today we're going to be talking about working with files in Python. Files are the bread and butter of data science: you'll be working with them all the time, in various formats, so its best to go ahead and learn the basics. 

## The Command Line
Before we start, let's go ahead and remind ourselves how to navigate the command line
### Directories
When we open up a terminal 
```bash
cd
cd ..
cd 
```

Generally, when working with a file in Python, you first have to open it and load it into memory. We can do this using the built-in `open` method:
```python
text = open('mobydick')
```
