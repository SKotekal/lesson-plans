## Workshop Objectives
1. Understand what happens between typing web address in browser and seeing the webpage.
2. Undestand the components and technologies in a webpage.
3. Be able to look at source of a webpage.
4. Be able to write simple script to interact with webpage.

## Division
1. Client
   * Browser
   * HTTP request
2. Server
   * Request Handling

## Browser
1. Web Page Source
   * Show how to see HTML/CSS/JS
2. Rendering a web page
   * Explain how HTML/CSS/JS work together to render a web page
3. Chrome Dev Tools Example
   * Boot up https://github.com/jakubtuchol and check out source

## Building Blocks
1. HTML
   * Markup language for web
   * Not very powerful by itself, but does provide fundamental building blocks
2. CSS
   * Styling for HTML pages
   * Fundamental building block for all visual effects on the web
3. JavaScript
   * Simple scripting language for the web
   * Every browser comes with built-in JS engine
   * De-facto standard for front-end web development
   * Also becoming popular for server-side development, thanks to projects like Node.js
4. Python
   * Simple, easy-to-use scripting language, very popular in web development
   * Dynamically-typed, interpreted, not statically-typed, not compiled
   * So much better than Java for web
5. XML/JSON
   * Data interchange formats, used by websites to communicate with browser
   * XML is set of tags
     * HTML is special case of XML
   * JSON is more lightweight than XML, but a bit less readable
6. API
   * Not set of unified technologies, but an interface which you can use to access a site
   * Example of Twitter API
