# Introduction, Part 2
## Lesson Overview
Today, we'll be learning about the two basic building blocks of Python program organization: functions and classes. Once we have a basic hold on the two of these, we'll go ahead and start working on a basic project that utilizes all that we've learned thus far. But before we head into functions, we're going to cover the tow most important data structures in Python.

## Lists
Lists are a super-fundamental part of Python programming, and are **super** awesome. We saw a list last lesson:
```python
print range(10)
print type(range(10))
```
As expected from the name, lists are lists of elements. They can contain pretty much whatever we want:
```python
seasons = ['spring', 'summer', 'autumn', 'winter']
crimson_tide_championships = [1925, 1926, 1930, 1934, 1941, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, 1979, 1992, 2009, 2011, 2012]
random_stuff = [192, 'hello', False]
```
We can also construct lists easily from scratch, adding one element at a time:
```python
techteamers = []
techteamers.append('Alita')
techteamers.append('Audriana')
techteamers.append('Carmin')
techteamers.append('Darius')
techteamers.append('Erin')
techteamers.append('Kevin')
techteamers.append('Olivia')
techteamers.append('Yujia')

print techteamers
```
Calling the `append` `
